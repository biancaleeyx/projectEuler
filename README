This is a collection of Python scripts to compute solutions for archived problems found on https://projecteuler.net/archives.

Each script is numbered with an initial number corresponding to the Problem Number in Project Euler.

Project Euler discourages the sharing of answers, use these scripts at the expense of your own intellectual discovery.
