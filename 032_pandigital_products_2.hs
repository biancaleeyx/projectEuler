Project Euler Problem 32: Pandigital products
We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; 
for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.
The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 × 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, 
and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

module Main where

digits :: String
digits = concat . map show $ [1..9]

-- me: what's the diff between $ and .?

-- "." is function composition (forgot the word). So (.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
-- "$" is function application. So ($) :: (a -> b) -> a -> b
--     same as space, except that it has the lowest priority in binding. So in the above example:
-- concat . map show $ [1..9]
-- = (concat . map show) [1..9]

mergePairs :: Ord a => [[a]] -> [[a]]
mergePairs [] = []

                       -- I'm not sure what is happening here. Does the 2nd mergePairs need to be there?
-- basically for list of lists [[a],[b],[c],[d]], this tries to do [[a,b],[c,d]] before merging all together
-- second mergepairs is to pairwise combine the rest i think

-- the problem here is that (assuming that it is logically sound in the first place), it's going to be slow and expensive memory-wise. I'll explain tonight.
